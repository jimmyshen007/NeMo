NEMO TOOL 2.0 now available!

We now have a new, improved version of the NeMo Tool. It is implemented through a website hosted on AWS, so there is no need to doanload any data or use Matlab.
It contains 415 Human Connectome Project control subjects' tractography results, and has many new features for using different gray matter parcellations, and even
allows voxel-wise ChaCo score output. Please see the website for more details. Happy lesioning!
